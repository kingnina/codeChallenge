In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services . 
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles . 
( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) . 
This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive . 
Moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; ; for example , if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years , rather than 44,000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16,000 miles respectively '' . 
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation . 
It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs . 
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work . 
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses .

**Word Count**
A java program named _wordCount.java_ counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory named /wc_input. Then it outputs the result to a file named wc_result.txt in the directory /wc_output.

**Running Median**
A java program named _RunMedian.java_ keeps track of the median for a stream of numbers, updating the median for each new number. Files in the /wc_input are processing in alphabetical order. The results are written into a text file named med_result.txt, which is in the /wc_output directory.

These programs filtered out files that are not .txt. Though we assume that all the files in the /wc_input is text files. However, during the implemenation, .DS_Store files, a hidden file created by MAC OSX,might be also included for the word processing. 

To execute the code, please run shell script _run.sh_.

**Word Count**
The java program wordCount.java counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory named /wc_input. Then it outputs the result to a file named wc_result.txt in the directory /wc_output.

***Running Median***
The java program RunMedian.java keeps track of the median for a stream of numbers, updating the median for each new number. Files in the /wc_input are processing in alphabetical order. The results are written into a text file named med_result.txt, which is in the /wc_output directory.
